        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I currently work as a Character Animator at Little Chicken Game Company, an Amsterdam based studio that has
            been designing award winning games since 2001. I've got my start in games as a Producer where I gained a lot
            of valuable experience about creative team leadership. But a lot of looong nights were spent on my passion:
            animation. So when the opportunity to work as a 3d animator presented itself in 2014, I never looked back.
        </p>

        <p> And now I've started the next phase of my career, by learning to code. I strive to create unique experiences
            that have an impact on people, or better yet, to spark the imagination of
            others through storytelling. And I feel that the modern superpower of programming will enable me to do so
            even more.
        </p>

        <p>Wish me luck!</p>
